My roadmap - from being a java dev to  AI/ML Engineer/Architect:


Phase 0 — Setup (2 weeks)
Pick stack: Python + PyTorch, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitHub Actions.
Read: systems design for data/ML (latency, throughput, SLOs, cost per request).
Deliverable: repo template with linting, tests, Makefile, DevContainer.
Phase 1 — Core ML Engineering (0–2 months)
Refresh math: linear algebra, prob/stats, optimization; implement logistic regression, tree, gradient boosting from scratch (numpy).
Libraries: scikit-learn, PyTorch Lightning; experiment tracking with MLflow.
Project 1: classic tabular ML (fraud/credit/churn). Ship a FastAPI inference service + Docker image.
Phase 2 — Data & MLOps Foundations (2–4 months)
Data eng: Airflow/Prefect, feature stores (Feast), data contracts, CDC basics.
CI/CD for ML: unit tests for data & models, model registry, canary/blue-green deploys.
Infra: AWS/GCP/Azure (pick one); IaC with Terraform; container orch: Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS).
Observability: Prometheus/Grafana, OpenTelemetry, drift/quality monitoring (whylogs/evidently).
Project 2: training pipeline + feature store + CI/CD to a k8s cluster with autoscaling.
Phase 3 — Generative AI & LLMOps (4–7 months)
RAG system design: chunking, embeddings, vector DBs (FAISS, Weaviate, pgvector), retrieval evaluation.
Prompt & policy: guardrails, PII filtering, prompt-injection defenses, evaluation harnesses (G-Eval style), offline & online metrics.
Latency/cost control: quantization (bitsandbytes, AWQ), batching, GPU vs CPU trade-offs, caching (semantic & response).
Project 3: production-grade RAG service with offline eval, A/B tests, and cost dashboards.
Phase 4 — Scalable Architectures (7–10 months)
Patterns: event-driven (Kafka), CQRS/Saga, idempotency, exactly-once with outbox.
Data @ scale: lakehouse (Delta/Apache Iceberg), streaming vs batch, feature freshness SLAs.
Security & governance: IAM least privilege, KMS, secrets mgmt, model cards, audit trails; multi-tenant isolation.
Project 4: multi-region, auto-failover AI API (CDN + WAF), RTO/RPO defined and tested.
Phase 5 — Platform & Enterprise Skills (10–14 months)
Platform thinking: standardized golden paths, reusable templates, cost guardrails, shared feature store.
Compliance: basic ISO 27001/SOC 2 mapping for AI workflows; DPIA for sensitive data.
Documentation: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), threat models, runbooks, postmortems.
Project 5 (capstone): “AI Platform Starter Kit” repo—one-click deploy of a full stack (ETL → training → registry → serving → monitoring), with cost and reliability SLOs.
Certifications
AWS Solutions Architect (Assoc → Pro) or Azure Architect Expert (AZ-305);
CKA (Kubernetes); Terraform Associate;
Optional: Databricks or GCP Professional ML Engineer (if that’s your stack).
Portfolio “Architect”
3 public reference architectures (diagrams + ADRs + costs + SLOs).
A RAG system with robust eval + safety filters + latency/cost charts.
A k8s-based serving stack with A/B & canary deploys, autoscaling, and rollback playbooks.
Cost-optimization case study (e.g., quantized model cutting GPU spend 30% with equal quality).
Interview & Comp Playbook
Systems-design drill: clarify reqs → constraints → candidate designs → trade-offs (latency, cost, privacy) → risks → mitigations. Whiteboard the data & control planes.
Behavioral: STAR stories for incidents, migrations, and cost reductions.
Negotiate total comp (base + bonus + RSUs). Leverage city bands (BLR/PNQ/HYD > others) and competing offers.

Quick start (next 14 days)
Day 1–3: spin up a k8s cluster (managed), deploy a toy FastAPI model with autoscaling.
Day 4–7: build a tiny RAG using pgvector + OpenAI/Local LLM; add offline eval harness.
Day 8–14: wire MLflow + CI/CD; add drift monitors; publish an ADR + diagram for your setup.
